Basic Vision:

The app contains a basic list that looks almost exactly like a contact list. Each contact contains a name, 
# of days since last call, and a button that says "Called". The button, when pressed, records the date and 
starts a new count of days since last called. The list is organized by days since last called (most recent at the bottom).

Due to Apple restrictions on call tracking the data will have to be manually recorded and stored within the app. Also, because I am
on Windows, the app will have to be created as a PWA. This means it will be a website that is "downloaded" to my phone.
